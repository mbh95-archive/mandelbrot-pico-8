# mandelbrot-pico-8

Tiny Mandelbrot renderer which allows you to pan and zoom around the Mandelbrot set in real-time. It renders at a low resolution and then slowly refines the image the longer you stay in the same place/zoom.

Controls:
- Pan around with the directional buttons
- Zoom in with button 4 (Z on kbd)
- Zoom out with button 5 (X on kbd)
- Toggle between two shading modes with second player's button 4 (LShift on kbd)
- Cycle through five different color palettes with second player's button 5 (A on kbd)

My first PICO-8 Cart! Now updated with color schemes and bugfixes! Maybe someday I'll  Julia sets.
