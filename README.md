# mandelbrot-pico-8

Tiny Mandelbrot renderer for the PICO-8 which allows you to pan and zoom around the Mandelbrot set in real-time. It renders at a low resolution and then slowly refines the image the longer you stay in the same place/zoom.

Controls:
- Pan around with the directional buttons
- Zoom in with button 4 (Z on kbd)
- Zoom out with button 5 (X on kbd)

My first PICO-8 Cart! Eventually I'd like to add different color schemes, and maybe Julia sets.
